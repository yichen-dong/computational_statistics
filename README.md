# Computational Statistics

This is code that I wrote for my class on Computational Statistics at JHU for my MS in DS. Most of the code is written in R. 

It has been a while since this class, but I can try to summarize what I was learning in each module. Module 1 and 2 did not have a code related assignment, and so is skipped.

- Module 3 was an introduction to gradient descent, and trying to find the minimum. I programmed in the algorithm behind Newton's method in R.
- Module 4 was an introduction to Monte Carlo methods for integration. 
- Module 5 involved Importance Sampling and Markov Chain Monte Carlo
- Module 6 was a continuation of Module 5
- Module 8 dealt with Randomization and Data Partitioning
- Module 9 was on bootstrapping
- Module 10 was on function estimation
- Module 11 was on density estimation
- Module 12 was on Bi-variate Smoothing
- My Final project was exploring how to perform optimization on Logistic Regression
